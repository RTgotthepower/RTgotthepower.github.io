       <h2>ðŸ‘‹ABOUT MEðŸ‘‹</h2>
    <p>Hello World! I'm Ryan Tatum, hailing from a quaint corner of the DFW metroplex known as Rockwall, TX. I am a junior at The illustrious Texas Southern University, pursuing my B.S. degree in Computer Science with a concentration in computer networks. I'm passionate about continuous learning and coding. On My free time i love to play basketball, videogames, cut hair, and also make educational (Programming) videos on youtube. I am Currently proficient in C++, Java, html, css, javascript, and C, I'm eagerly gearing up to conquer Python next!<br>
    <p>In addition to my academic pursuits, I serve as the CEO of the AI Avengers, a dynamic group of computer science enthusiasts dedicated to empowering others through coding tutorials across various programming languages. On a personal note, I share how-to videos on both hairstyling and coding tips on my YouTube channel.</p><br>

        <h2>ðŸ“±C++ ProjectsðŸ“±</h2>
        <li><p>Real-time Strategy(RTS)Game Engine</p></li>
        <p>This project involves implementing game mechanics such as unit movement, resource management, AI, pathfinding algorithms, and graphical rendering using libraries like SDL or SFML. You can also explore networking to support multiplayer functionality.</p>
        <li><p>Mock Compiler</p></li>
        <p> This project involved parsing, lexical analysis, syntax analysis, semantic analysis, and code generation. </p>
        <li><p>Student Gradebook:</p></li>
        <p>manages a student gradebook. Users can add students, record grades for assignments and exams, calculate averages, and generate reports. I used data structures like linked lists to store student information and implement functions for data manipulation and analysis.</p>
        <li><p>Image Processing Tool</p></li>
        <p>I Developed a program that performs basic image processing operations such as resizing, cropping, rotating, and applied filters. I used libraries like OpenCV for image manipulation and user interface frameworks like Qt or GTK for creating a graphical interface.</p><br>

        <h2>ðŸ“±Java ProjectsðŸ“±</h2>
        <li><p>Chat Application</p></li>
        <p>I Created a real-time chat application that allows users to send messages to each other over a network. I Used Java Socket programming to establish connections between clients and a server.i also Implemented features like private messaging, group chat, and online/offline status tracking and also add encryption for secure communication.</p>
        <li><p>Tic-Tac-Toe Game</p></li>
        <p>I Created a simple console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game where two players take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid to try to get three in a row.and implemented the game logic, user input handling, and a graphical representation of the game board.</p>
        <li><p>Space Invaders Clone</p></li>
        <p>I Built a clone of the classic Space Invaders arcade game where the player controls a spaceship that shoots down waves of descending aliens while avoiding their projectiles. I used Java's graphics and animation capabilities to create the game's visuals and handle game mechanics.</p>
